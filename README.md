# Mass-Shootings-USA-Project

### Introduction

The topic of gun violence and civilian weapon ownership has been a sensitive and painful topic in American society. With the frequent, data-proven growing trend of mass murder in the US, activists and politicians voice increasing concern for the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the abuse of weapon ownership. With the copious analytics and data harvested on mass shooting incidents across the nation, lawmakers look for informed, data-driven arguments to influence rational policy to mitigate the severity of the issue. 
Moreover, our society is constantly flooded with mass media headlines and news stories covering tragedies across the nation on a near daily basis. Making sense of mainstream media agendas and headlines may lead to incorrect assumptions and distortion of the raw image of the present day. Our intended audience is a wide portion of our society, but in particular, people looking to be enlightened by the raw data as educated constituents, as well as individuals in power capable of shaping policy and initiative. Both sides of the table need access to this data and its raw conclusions.
For the most part, the urgency of the situation at hand as well as its severity is unanimous across our society, however, the history, statistics, and trends that should influence and manifest legal action are not. Our overarching message to our wide audience of constituents and officials is apt to be interpreted in ideally one fashion: mass shootings are a problem, and our proven weak legislature on weapons and mental health screening needs to change as soon as possible. 
To answer our study questions, we set out to utilize a wide variety of visuals to fully encompass and immerse our audience in our analysis. Pointing to different directions and ways to visualize and interpret our data was productive in both validating our conclusions as well as appealing to our audience visually. Within that direction, however, we decided to avoid oversophisticating and varying our visuals. We ultimately picked a roster of different visuals following the same foundation structures to maintain some uniformity and consistency in our presentation.

### Study Questions

- What clear trends exist regarding populations susceptible to gun violence perpetration? (Race, Gender, Age)
- Are mass shootings related to prior mental health concerns?
- What types of weapons are involved in mass shootings (legality, type, etc.)?
- What is the ongoing political legislature targeting to mitigate the impacts of gun violence? Does our data support it?
